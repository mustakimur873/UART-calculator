# Introduction
Our final project was a UART-based Calculator, designed to facilitate user interaction through a terminal window that communicates with the TI TIVA board. This project aimed to create a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations, showcasing the capabilities of embedded systems in a practical application.

# Background and Methodology
In developing our UART-based Calculator, we applied key concepts from embedded systems, including real-time data processing and serial communication. The primary outcome was a functional calculator capable of handling addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and logical shifting  while maintaining a responsive user interface. We utilized the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller, focusing on the following peripherals:
- SysTick Timer: This was used to introduce delays in the program, allowing for effective management of user input and ensuring smooth operation.
- UART Module: The UART module facilitated serial communication between the TI TIVA board and the TeraTerm software terminal, enabling users to input commands and receive results seamlessly.
